`buffLevelUpTracking` sometimes triggered and sometimes not, tested by using givexp and already existing debug statements of `buffLevelUpTracking`.  
They are printed to the player on level up, by pressing F1. However, the debug statements themselves do not get printed sometimes, leading to a buggy behaviour.
